**Solution Considered** <br>

Linear Search Approach

    Reading the entire log file line by line.
    Checking each lineâ€™s date and extracting logs matching the target date.

Binary Search on the Entire File

    Binary search is the most efficient solution since the logs are sorted, but i was not able to implement it under time.
